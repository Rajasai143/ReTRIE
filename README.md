# ReTRIE
ReTRIE enhances mobile-based retinal imaging with a Transformer-CycleGAN framework that improves contrast, reduces noise, and restores fine retinal structures for better diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging Vision Transformers and CycleGAN, it ensures high-quality image restoration, making retinal images more suitable for clinical diagnostics.
